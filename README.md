# Data-Analysis-on-Stroke-Prediction-Dataset
Through data analysis, researchers can identify correlations and patterns in the data that may be useful in predicting the risk of stroke. This analysis may involve  Exploratory Data and Analysis (EDA)  using R and RStudio to gain deeper understanding about each data and their relationship . Additionally, data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, scatter plot and heat maps may be used to help illustrate the patterns and trends in the data using GGPLOT2 and other libraries as well. 

The primary goal of this research is to carry out an in-depth analysis and correctly identify the proper  variable that has the greatest impact and influence on patients who is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters given in Stroke Prediction Dataset.
